This game is based on prototype2. I modified the narrative to present the legend of Atlantis. 
Players need to collect 12 crystals in the sea in order to win. They will be killed if they run into the mushrooms or flying monsters that always chase after them.

Design Question:
How should I set up the barriers in order to make game tough but enjoyable?

Playtest questions:
1. Do you like the environment,the lighting settings and background music?
2. Is it easy to get the Crystals?
3. How do you feel about the narrative presented in this game?
4. Any bugs during play?
5. (optional)Anything you feel important to say about this game?
